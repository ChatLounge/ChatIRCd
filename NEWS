-- charybdis-3.4.2

server protocol
- Fix a remote-triggerable crash triggered by the CAPAB parsing code.

-- charybdis-3.4.1

oper
- Fix a crash with /testline.

-- charybdis-3.4.0

misc
- Fix a compilation issue in libratbox/src/sigio.c with recent glibc.
- Extend documentation slightly.
- Remove a BSD advertising clause that permission was granted to remove.

-- charybdis-3.4.0-rc2

server protocol
- Fix bugs introduced in charybdis-3.4.0-rc1 that caused the CAPAB line to
  be ignored (all capabilities were assumed to be present).
- Fix propagation of ip_cloaking hostname changes (only when setting or
  unsetting the umode after connection).
user
- Allow mode queries on mlocked modes. In particular, allow /mode #channel f
  to query the forward channel even if +f is mlocked.
misc
- Work around timerfd/signalfd brokenness on OpenVZ.

-- charybdis-3.4.0-rc1

server protocol
- Allow overriding opers (with the new override extension) to op themselves
  on channels.
- Add channel ban forwarding <mask>$<channel> much like ircd-seven. Local use
  of this is controlled by the channel::use_forward config option.
- Allow RSFNC (forced nick change from services) to change a nickname's
  capitalization only.
- Add ENCAP TGINFO to propagate IP addresses that exceeded target change
  limits (these get a lower limit when they reconnect). The message's source
  is the user that exceeded the limit and one parameter "0" is required.
user
- Consider bogus CTCP ACTION messages (without action text) CTCP (for
  cmode +C).
- Apply colour stripping (cmode +c) and CTCP checking (cmode +C) to messages
  to @/+ channel as well.
- Channel mode +c (and other places that disallow colour codes) now also strip
  ASCII 4 (a different kind of colour code).
- Add an error message (numeric 743) if a ban mask is invalid.
- Extract the underlying IPv4 address from 6to4 and Teredo IPv6 addresses.
  Show it in a remote /whois and check channel bans, quiets, D:lines and
  K:lines against it. Note that ban exceptions and auth{} blocks are not
  checked.
- Send ERR_TOOMANYCHANNELS for each channel join that fails due to channel
  limits, instead of one per JOIN command.
- Add account-notify client capability to notify clients about logins and
  logouts of users in common channels. See doc/account-notify.txt.
- Add away-notify client capability. See doc/away-notify.txt.
- Add extended-join client capability to add account name and ircname to JOIN.
  See doc/extended-join.txt.
- Add topic TS and channel TS constraints for /LIST (T<, T>, C<, C>
  parameters as in some other servers).
- Disallow wildcarded nicknames in "hunted" parameters like /stats and /motd.
- Disallow mIRC italics in channel names when disable_fake_channels.
- Add AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL support, allows SASL authentication using an SSL
  certificate fingerprint.
- Allow channel::kick_on_split_riding to protect channels with mlocked keys.
  This works with atheme-services 5.2.0 or newer.
- The NICKLEN token in 005 now only specifies the maximum nick length for
  this server/user. The MAXNICKLEN token specifies the maximum nick length
  any user can have.
- Disallow '$' in usernames as this may cause problems with ban forwarding.
- Allow normal users to perform /privs on themselves, showing some privileges
  from the auth{} block.
- Rate limit high-bandwidth commands, in particular /who <channel>.
- Rate limit /away to help avoid flooding via away-notify.
oper
- Add operspy for /list.
- Add /stats C to show information about dynamically loaded server
  capabilities.
- Add a server notice to snomask +b if a user exceeds target change limits.
- Add missing server notice for kills from RSFNC and SVSLOGIN.
config
- Add support for linking using SSL certificate fingerprints as the link
  credential rather than the traditional password pair.
- Add channel::disable_local_channels config option.
- Add support for IPv6 DNSBLs. A new "type" option specifies the IP version(s)
  for which each DNSBL should be checked.
- Make flood control settings configurable by those who know exactly what they
  are doing.
- Add serverinfo::nicklen config option to limit the nick length for local
  users. Different values of this option do not break the server protocol.
- Add general::away_interval to allow configuring /away rate limiting.
- Add listener::defer_accept to delay accepting a connection until the client
  sends data. This depends on kernel support. It may break BOPM checking.
- Add general::resv_fnc to forcibly change nicks of local users that match a
  newly set nick RESV, default enabled.
- Add m_roleplay extension, provides various roleplay commands.
- Add override extension, umode +p oper override for opers with oper:override
  permission, with accountability notices and timeout. Note that opers cannot
  op themselves if there are older servers on the network.
- Add extb_usermode extension, $m:+-<modes> extban matching against umodes.
- Extend extb_oper extension to allow matching against oper privileges.
- Add m_remove extension, /remove command as in ircd-seven.
misc
- In mkpasswd, default to SHA512-based crypt instead of MD5-based crypt.
- Add --with-custom-branding and --with-custom-version configure options to
  help forks/patchsets distinguish themselves.
- Change version control system from Mercurial to GIT.
- Ensure SIGHUP and SIGINT keep working after a SIGINT restart.
- Add --enable-fhs-paths configure option to allow installing into a more
  FHS-like hierarchy.
- Remove broken GnuTLS support. SSL/TLS is now only provided using OpenSSL.

-- charybdis-3.3.0

server protocol
- Add new BAN command, for propagated network-wide bans (K/X:lines and RESVs).
  These will burst to new servers as they are introduced, and will stay in sync
  across the whole network (new BAN capab).
- Add new MLOCK command, to implement ircd-side channel mode locks. This allows
  services to send out a list of mode letters for a given channel which may not
  be changed, preventing mode fights between services and client bots (new MLOCK
  capab).
user
- New RPL_QUIETLIST(728) and RPL_ENDOFQUIETLIST(729) numerics are used for the
  quiet (+q) list, instead of overloading the ban list numerics.
- Users may no longer change the topic of a -t channel if they cannot send to
  it.
- Add help for EXTBAN, describing the syntax of extended bans in general, as
  well as the most common types.
- Changed AWAY messages are now propagated to other servers. Previously, AWAY
  was only propagated when the user was not already away.
- Channel mode +c (and other places that disallow colour codes) now also strip
  ASCII 29 (mIRC 7 italics).
- Add auto-accept for user mode +g (callerid): Messaging a user while set +g
  will automatically add them to your accept list.
- Add target change for channels.  It applies to unopped, unvoiced and unopered
  users.  This has the effect of stopping spambots which join, message and part
  many channels at a time.
- Show RPL_WHOISLOGGEDIN in /whowas as well as in /whois entries.  This adds at
  most an additional 0.5MB of memory usage.
oper
config
- Add general::use_propagated_bans to switch the new BAN system on or off.
- Add general::default_ident_timeout, to control the timeout for identd (auth)
  connections.
- Add channel::channel_target_change to switch the new channel target change limits
  on or off.
- Fix class::number_per_ident so that it also applies to connections without
  identd.
- Change the example sslport option to 6697, which is more standard than 9999.
misc
- The custom channel mode API has been rewritten, allowing these modules to work
  correctly when reloaded, or loaded from the config file.
- The EFNet RBL is now recommended, instead of DroneBL.
- Remove the unsupported modules directory.
- Numerous bug fixes and code cleanups.
- In mkpasswd, default to MD5 crypt instead of insecure DES.

-- charybdis-3.2.0

server protocol
- Apply +z to messages blocked by +b and +q as well. (new EOPMOD capab)
- Add new topic command ETB, allowing services to set topic+setter+ts always.
  (new EOPMOD capab)
- The slash ('/') character is now allowed in spoofs.
user
- Add can_kick hook, based on the ircd-seven one.
- Add cmode +C (no CTCP) from ircd-seven.
- Flood checking has been reworked.
- Fix op-moderate (cmode +z) for channel names with '@'.
- Add CERTFP support, allowing users to connect with an SSL client
  certificate and propagating the certificate fingerprint to other servers.
  Services packages can use this to identify users based on client
  certificates.
- Maintain the list of recently used targets (for the target change
  anti-spam system) in most-recently-used order, overwriting the least
  recently used target with a new one. This should be friendlier to users
  without giving spambots anything.
- Do not require target change slots for replying to the last five users to
  send a private message, notice or invite.
- Apply target change restrictions to /invite.
- Apply umode +g/+R restrictions to /invite, with the difference that
  instead of sending "<user> is messaging you" the invite is let through
  since that is just as noisy.
oper
- Add /rehash throttles to clear throttling.
- Send all server notices resulting from a remote /rehash to the oper.
- '\s' for space is now part of the matching, not a substitution at xline
  time, fixing various issues with it.
- Display o:line "nickname" in oper-up server notices.
- Fix sendq exceeded snotes for servers.
- SCAN UMODES: default list-max to 500, like a global WHO.
- Ignore directory names in MODRELOAD to avoid crashing if it is a core
  module and the path is incorrect.
- Tweaks to spambot checks.
config
- Add channel::only_ascii_channels config option to restrict channel names
  to printable ascii only.
- Add channel::resv_forcepart, forcibly parts local users on channel RESV,
  default enabled.
misc
- New mkpasswd from ircd-ratbox.
- Check more system calls for errors and handle the errors.
- Various ssld/libratbox bugfixes from ircd-ratbox. [some MERGED]
- Fix fd passing on FreeBSD/amd64 and possibly Solaris/sparc. [MERGED]
- Various documentation improvements. [some MERGED]
- Fix some crash issues. [MERGED]
- Add bandb from ircd-ratbox, which stores permanent dlines/klines/xlines/resvs
  in an sqlite database instead of a flatfile and does the storage in a
  helper process. Use bin/bantool -i to import your old bans into the
  database.

-- charybdis-3.1.0

- Remove TS5 support. No TS5 servers are permitted in a network with
  charybdis 3.1.0 or newer, except jupes.
- Replace oper flags by privilege sets (privsets). This adds an extra
  level of indirection between oper flags and operator blocks. /stats O
  (capital O) shows the configured privsets.
- Update libratbox and ssld from upstream and use it better.
- Add auth_user to auth{}. This allows specifying a username:password instead
  of just a password in PASS, so that a fixed user@host is not necessary
  for a specific auth{} block.
- Add need_ssl to auth{} and operator{}. This makes these blocks reject
  the user if not connected via SSL.
- Allow modules to provide simple channel modes without parameter.
- Remove restrictions on CNAME in the resolver.
- Make the resolver remember nonresponsive nameservers.
- Move nick collision notices from +s to +k.
- Add additional information to various server notices about server
  connections.
- Show throttle information in /stats t.
- Show rejectcache and throttle information in /testline.
- Show oper reason in /testline.
- Allow opers to see other users' umodes with /mode <nick>.
- SCAN UMODES GLOBAL NO-LIST MASK <mask> is no longer an operspy command.
- Also apply floodcount to messages to remote clients (except services).
- Remove user@server messages to local users. Sending such messages to
  remote servers is still possible, for securely messaging pseudoservers
  whether service{}'ed or not. The special oper-only syntax opers@server
  remains as well.
- Allow /list on a named +p channel. A full /list already included +p channels.
- Add operspy /topic.
- For remote rehashes, send error messages to the requesting oper as well.
- Disable autoconnect for a server with excessive TS delta.
- Disallow invites to juped channels.
- Warn about certain duplicate and redundant auth blocks.
- Make PRIVMSG/NOTICE behave as CPRIVMSG/CNOTICE automatically if possible.
- Allow +z messages from outside if a channel is -n.
- Allow coloured part reasons in -c channels.
- Add ircu-like WHOX support. This allows requesting specific information
  in /who and allows obtaining services login name for all users in a
  channel. XChat/Conspire use WHOX to update away status more efficiently.
- Allow opers and shide_exempt users to see hopcounts even if flatten_links
  is on.
- Rework ip_cloaking.
- Add the IP address to userlog, as in ircd-ratbox 3.0.
- Split cidr_bitlen into cidr_ipv4_bitlen and cidr_ipv6_bitlen.
- Allow using ziplinks with SSL connections. This is not as efficient as
  using OpenSSL's built in compression, but also works with older versions
  of OpenSSL.
- Fix an off by one error with zipstats processing, which could overwrite
  a variable with NULL causing a crash on some systems.
- Document some extensions in charybdis-oper-guide.
- Add more server protocol documentation.
- Add m_sendbans extension, SENDBANS command to propagate xlines and resvs
  manually.

- Use sendto_one_notice() more.
- Server notices about kills now include the victim's nick!user@host instead
  of just nick.
- Include real hostname in Closing Link message for unknown connections
  that have sent USER, in particular banned users.
- Add some documentation about the SASL client protocol.
- Change spambot, flooder and jupe joiner notices from host to orighost.

  have multiple servers with similar names appear as a single server).
- Keep bitmasks of modularized umodes reserved forever to the letter,
  avoiding problems when reloading umode modules in a different order.
- Fix -logfile.
- Update to the new revision (v8) of the TS6 spec, this fixes problems with
  joins reversing certain mode changes crossing them. This interoperates
  with older versions.

- Fix invisible count getting desynched from reality if the act of opering
  up sets -i or +i.
- Don't leak auth{} spoofed IP addresses in +f notices.
- Shorten quit/part/kick reasons to avoid quit reasons overflowing the
  client exiting server notice (from TOPICLEN to 260).
- Fix some cases where 10 char usernames lose their final character.
- Move username check after xline and dnsbl checks, so it will not complain
  to opers about clients who are xlined or blacklisted anyway (both of

  single ban exception existed on a channel.
- Tweak \s code a little.
- Add a minor clarification to the SGML docs.

  memberships.
- Make the SID-collision notice look right under all conditions.

- Implement channel mode +P primarily as a status mode, permanant 
  channel -- this is usually enforced via services registrations.
- Change behaviour of /stats p: now displays all staff members instead
  of local ones only.
- Make oper_list global, add local_oper_list for local traffic.
- Strip control codes from parts and quits.
- Add channel mode +c which strips control codes from messages sent to
  the channel.
- Add channel mode +g which enables free use of the /invite command.
- Add channel mode +z which sends rejected messages to channel ops.
  Could be useful for Q&A sessions or other similar events.
- Add channel quietmasks. These are recommended over the use of channel
  bans used to remove a user's ability to participate in the channel.
- Add channel join throttling mode, +j. Used to throttle channel join
  traffic, i.e. join/part flood attacks. Syntax: +j <joins>:<timeslice>
- Improvements to channel_modes(), from shadowircd -- allows for
  better construction of the mode string.
- Use the undernet throttle notice instead of bancache message when
  dealing with rejected clients. (stolen from ircu2.10.12)
- Add channel forwarding, via channel mode +f, behaves similarly to
  dancer-ircd version.
- Update example.conf to reflect AthemeNET changes. Original ratbox
  config is now reference.conf.
- Services account names are now tracked globally.
- Add channel mode +Q which disables the effects of channel forwarding
  on a temporary basis.
- Add channel mode +F which allows anybody to disable forwarding target
  authorisation, voluntarily on their channels.
- Make wallops behave like normal wallops.
- Add services aliases: /ns, /cs, /os, /nickserv, /chanserv, /operserv.
- Add simple hack that enables use of server password for automatic
  identify.
