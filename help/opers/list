LIST [#channel]|[modifiers]

Without any arguments, LIST will give an entire list of all
channels which are not set as secret (+s). The list will be in
the form:

  <#channel> <amount of users> :[topic]

If an argument supplied is a channel name, LIST will give just
the statistics for the given channel.

Modifiers are also supported, seperated by a comma:
  <n - List channels with less than n users
  >n - List channels with more than n users
  C<n - List channels created in the last n minutes
  C>n - List channels older than n minutes
  T<n - List channels whose topics have changed in the
        last n minutes
  T>n - List channels whose topics were last changed
        more than n minutes ago

eg LIST <100,>20
