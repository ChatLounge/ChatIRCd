Extended Help for the Combination extbans $& (AND) and $| (OR).
Please see the help for EXTBAN to see a list of all other possible
extbans.

Basic example:

$&:~a,h:*!webchat@*
Which means: match unidentified webchat users if all webchat users
have the 'webchat' ident.
("h" is another new extban type, which just does a normal match).

More complicated example:

$&:~a,|:(h:*!*@*.abusive.lusers,h:*!*@127.0.0.1)
Which means: unidentified users connecting from either the abusive.lusers
ISP or from 127.0.0.1 .

Rules:

 - Optional pair of parens around data.

 - component bans are separated by commas, but commas between
   matching pairs of parens are skipped.

 - Unbalanced parens are an error.

 - Parens, commas and backslashes can be escaped by backslashes.

 - A backslash before any character other than a paren or backslash
   is just a backslash (backslash and character are both used).

 - Non-existant extbans are invalid.
   This is primarily for consistency with non-combined bans:
   the ircd does not let you set +b $f unless the 'f' extban is loaded,
   so setting $&:f should be impossible too.
