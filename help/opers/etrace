ETRACE [-full|-v4|-v6|nick]

With no argument, ETRACE gives a list of all clients connected
to the local server, both users and operators.

With -full option, ETRACE lists all clients along with the
two unused fields sent in the USER command when they connected.

When ipv6 is enabled, the -v4 and -v6 options display clients
using ipv4 and ipv6 respectively.

You may also specify a specific nickname to ETRACE.  The target
can be a local or remote client, however the ETRACE will be "lost"
if the remote server does not support this extension.  The
"-full" option will be implied and should not be specified with
it.
