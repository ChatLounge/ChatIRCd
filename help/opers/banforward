Extended help for ban forwards.  For more information on channel
bans, please see CMODE.

Ban forwards are a mechanism by which users who match
a given channel ban will be forwarded to the specified channel.

In order to set such a ban, one or more of following criteria
needs to be met:

- The setter needs to be channel operator or higher on
  the *target* channel.
- Alternatively, the *target* channel may be set +F.  If so,
  there's no need to be op on the target channel.

Syntax:

/mode #Source +b banmask$#TargetChannel

Examples:

/mode #Source +b TooMany!Excess@Flood.Quits.tld$#FixYourConnection
/mode #Source +b *!Lamer@2.many.leet.kiddiots.tld$#PenaltyBox
