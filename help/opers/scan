SCAN UMODES +<modes>-<modes> [NO-LIST] [LIST] [GLOBAL]
            [LIST-MAX <number>] [MASK <nick!user@host>]

Searches the local server or network for users that have the
umodes given with + and do not have the umodes given with -.
NO-LIST disables the listing of matching users and only
shows the count. LIST enables the listing (default). GLOBAL
extends the search to the entire network instead of local
users only. LIST-MAX limits the listing of matching users to
the given amount instead of the default 500. MASK causes
only users matching the given nick!user@host mask to be
selected. Only the displayed host is considered, not the
IP address or real host behind dynamic spoofs.

Network searches where a listing is given are operspy
commands.
