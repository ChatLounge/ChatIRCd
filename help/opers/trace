TRACE [server | nick] [location]

With no argument, TRACE gives a list of all clients connected
to the local server, both users and operators.

With one argument which is a server, TRACE displays the path 
to the specified server, and all servers, opers and -i users
on that server.

Nonopers can only see themselves, opers and servers in the
first two forms.

With one argument which is a client, TRACE displays the
path to that client, and that client's information.

If location is given, the command is executed on that server;
no path is displayed.
