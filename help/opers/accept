ACCEPT <parameter>

ACCEPT allows you to control who can send you a NOTICE or PRIVMSG
while you have user mode +g enabled.

Accepted users can also message you if you have user mode +R
enabled, even if they are not logged in with services.

For +g: /QUOTE ACCEPT <nick>   -- Add a permitted nickname
        /QUOTE ACCEPT -<nick>  -- Remove a permitted nickname
        /QUOTE ACCEPT *        -- List the present permitted nicknames
