     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  HOW TO BUILD

   1. 

       Read the NEWS file to find out about the exciting new features in
       this version. Other good reads are doc/example.conf, doc/reference.conf,
	   and README.FIRST.

   2. 

       Run the configure script.  It will create include/setup.h and the
       Makefiles to match your system.  In ircd-ratbox, the paths are now handled
       with the --prefix option to configure, not in config.h.
       $HOME/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.

       ./configure --prefix="$HOME/ircd"

         Note: There are some special optional parameters to the configure
         script that some admins may wish to use.

          * 

            --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as
            opposed to the default poll(2).  This is currently only available
            on FreeBSD 4.1 or higher.

          * 

            --enable-devpoll - Enable the superior /dev/poll support on
            Solaris.  Linux /dev/poll is broken and will not work with this
            option.

          * 

            --enable-epoll - Enable the superior Linux Edge-Triggered Polling
            system.  This is currently only available on 2.5 Linux kernel
            versions or later.

          * 

            --enable-openssl - Enable the openssl dependent crypto functions.
            This will allow CHALLENGE to work and encrypted links.  On systems
            where the configure script can automatically detect OpenSSL, this
            option is not necessary.  If configure cannot find OpenSSL, you
            must specify a path with this option
            (--enable-openssl=/path/to/openssl)

          * 

            --enable-assert[=OPTION] - Enable some debugging code. OPTION is
            either 'soft' or 'hard' (default: hard).  'hard' should never be
            used on production servers as it may generate unnecessary cores.
            'soft' prevents cores from being generated but still imposes some
            additional load.

          * 

            --enable-small-net - Tunes the server for smaller networks by
            reducing the startup memory footprint.  This should really only be
            used for *small* networks, as this tends to be a performance hit
            on larger networks.

          * 

            --with-nicklen=LENGTH - Sets the maximum NICK length.  Note that
            this must be consistent across the entire network.

          * 
		  
            --with-topiclen=LENGTH - Sets the maximum TOPIC length.  Note that
			this must be consistent across the entire network.
   3. 

       'make' should build ircd.

   4. 

       'make install' will install the server, modules, and tools in the
       the prefix specified when configure was run.

   5. 

       If you wish to enable the user log, oper log, and failed oper log,
       issue these commands at the shell prompt (in the prefix directory)

 $ touch logs/userlog
 $ touch logs/operlog
 $ touch logs/foperlog

         Note: If you use different names in ircd.conf, you must 'touch' the
         specific names.

                                HOW TO GET HELP

   Send Check or Money Order to... just kidding!  You're on your own for
   support.  You may try asking the development channel on ChatLounge if you can't
   fix it yourself.  The channel may be found at: #ChatIRCd @ irc.chatlounge.net
   If you do fix anything, however, please send context or unified diffs to
   the development team at the development channel so the fixes can be incorporated
   into the next release of ChatIRCd.  If ChatIRCd crashes on you, PLEASE contact
   Ben @ irc.chatlounge.net ASAP with a backtrace of the core.

   DISCUSSION: There is development channel for discussion of ChatIRCd issues.
    To join:
       #ChatIRCd @ irc.chatlounge.net
       
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     NOTES

   The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
   instructions:

   1. 

       Change to the directory containing the core file

   2. 

       Run 'gdb' on the binary and the core file. With an unmodified ChatIRCd
       installation, an example command line is below (in the $HOME/ircd
       directory)

 $ gdb bin/ircd core

   3. 

       At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt full"

   4. 

       Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to the development
       team at #ChatIRCd @ irc.chatlounge.net .

   5. 

       Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a
       safe place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace
       provides.

                                 OPENSSL NOTES

   Older FreeBSD machines sometimes have the obsolete ports version of
   OpenSSL libcrypto in /usr/local/lib.  When configure is used with
   --enable-openssl, and libintl is detected in /usr/local/lib, the
   /usr/local/lib directory will be searched BEFORE the system /usr/lib for
   libraries by the linker.  The linker may try to link to the old
   /usr/local/lib libcrypto instead of the system /usr/lib libcrypto.  Some
   older versions may cause error messages similar to the following:

 gcc -g -O2 -DIRCD_PREFIX=\"/home/wcampbel/ircd\" -Wl,-export-dynamic
 -L/usr/local/lib -o ircd blalloc.o channel.o vchannel.o class.o client.o

 /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so: undefined reference to `ERR_load_RSAREF_strings'
 /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so: undefined reference to `RSA_PKCS1_RSAref'
 *** Error code 1

   If this is the case, you may need to rerun configure without the
   --enable-openssl option, manually edit src/Makefile and modules/Makefile
   to put -L/usr/lib before the -L/usr/local/lib in LDFLAGS, or remove the
   old OpenSSL from /usr/local, and recompile all applications that use
   libcrypto to use the system one.
