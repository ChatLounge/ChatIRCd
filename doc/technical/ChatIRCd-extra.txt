USERMODE (Services command)

Description:
Changes the user modes of another user, similar to SVSMODE/SVS2MODE in other
IRCds.  You may not (de)oper other opers this way, nor can you set oper
override (umode +p).

Syntax: :WWWXXXXXX ENCAP server.domain.tld USERMODE YYYZZZZZZ :+iw

Where WWWXXXXXX is the EUID of the source, and YYYZZZZZZ is the EUID of the
target.

Example: :101AAAAAB ENCAP test.hub2 USERMODE 111AAAAAB :+Qw

Note:
Ideally the server name should be the one the user is on, but it can also be
the direct uplink from services.  The server will pass on the message to the
server the user is on.
