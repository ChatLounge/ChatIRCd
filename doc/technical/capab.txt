Server capabilities

-------------------

Not all TSora IRCd's support these.

QS          - supports Quit Storm (SQUIT does not have to send recursive quits)
EX          - supports ban exceptions (+e)
CHW         - supports messages directed to channel operators only i.e. @#channel
IE          - supports invite exceptions (+I)
EOB         - supports end of burst notification (EOB token)
KLN         - supports remote KLINE
UNKLN       - supports remote UNKLINE
GLN         - supports hybrid7-style GLINE (:oper GLINE user host :reason)
HOPS        - supports halfops (+h -- %<nick>)
HUB         - denotes that the target server is a HUB
AOPS        - supports anonymous ops (+a, op hiding/op status hiding)
KNOCK       - supports KNOCK extension (request invite to +ikl channel)
TBURST      - supports old TBURST command [broken, don't use.]
TB          - supports new TB command [do use.]
PARA        - supports sending invite notices via INVITE from server
ENCAP       - supports message encapsulation
SERVICES    - supports ratbox's services extensions
SAVE        - supports SAVE extension (friendlier alternative to KILL on nick collide)
RSFNC       - supports RSFNC extension (forcenick)
CLUSTER     - supports remote XLINE, UNXLINE, RESV, UNRESV and LOCOPS
EUID        - supports EUID, non-ENCAP CHGHOST and NICKDELAY
ZIP         - supports ziplinks
ENC         - supports encryption (cryptlinks)

The KLN, UNKLN and CLUSTER capabilities do not apply to klines, xlines
and resvs sent over ENCAP.

Disabling ban/invite exceptions in ircd.conf does not remove the EX/IE capabs.
