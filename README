Development Team.

Contact: #ChatIRCd at irc.chatlounge.net

In addition to original code, it may include some features and code from
ShadowIRCd, ElementalIRCd, Ircd-seven, and elsewhere.

Differences from Charybdis 3.5.x:

- Global nick change notices (snomask +N)
- SNO_SPY Server notices (extensions/sno_*_notice.c) are now global
    (L_NETWIDE).
- Usermode +B (Mark as bot in whois)
- Usermode +t - When enabled, only SSL/TLS users may message you.
- Oper override does not expire.  It still generates
    notices when used.
- Usermodes are shown in /whois.  Only shown when
    an oper performs the whois, and/or a self-whois.
- When a K-lined user connects, snomask +K shows it.
- Default initial channel modes are now +nst if not configured.
- Extended ban type $u.  $u:nick!ident@host matches any clients
    that are not identified to services.
- Higher configurable channel limit for either certain opers or auth{} blocks.
- Network Administrator, or NetAdmin role, "higher" than "Admin."
    NetAdmin is required to perform remote rehash, restart, and module loading.
- Channel modes are now shown in /list and /olist.
- Miscellaneous oper-override fixes.
- WHO 'f' flag shows bot status.
- Opers with umode +B (bot mode) are no longer counted in /lusers.
- By default, opers may not (un)set umode +B.
- Optional static part reasons. - If set, all channel part reasons are
    the same.
- Optional static quit reasons. - If set, all quit reasons are the same.
- /whois shows oper block name.
- Local channels are no longer supported.
- /join 0 is now disabled by default; PARTALL replaces it.
- /why command - Tells you why a user is banned, or can join a channel
    despite restrictive modes.  Requires channel operator and/or
    IRC operator status.
- FJOIN/SVSJOIN
- ENCAP USERMODE (intended for a potential /ns umodesOnID feature)
- /uninvite command - Lets channel ops uninvite a user.

In addition, these differences from Charybdis 3.4.2:
- Channel mode +T blocks channel notices.
- SSLv3 is an older encryption protocol that's no longer supported.
    SSL clients must support at least TLS v1.0+.
- Initial channel modes when a channel is created are
    now configurable with the 'autochanmodes'
    option.
