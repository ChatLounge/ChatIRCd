This IRCd is a Charybdis fork, developed by the Chat Lounge IRC Network
Development Team.

In addition to original code, it may include some features and code from
ShadowIRCd, ElementalIRCd, Ircd-seven, and elsewhere.

Differences from Charybdis 3.5.0:

- Global nick change notices (snomask +N)
- SNO_SPY Server notices (extensions/sno_*_notice.c) are now global
	(L_NETWIDE).
- Usermode +B (Mark as bot in whois)
- Usermode +t - When enabled, only SSL/TLS users may message you.
- Oper override does not expire.  It still generates
	notices when used.
- Usermodes are shown in /whois.  Only shown when
	an oper performs the whois, or a self-whois.
- When a K-lined user connects, snomask +K shows it.
- Initial channel modes when a channel is created are
	now configurable with the 'autochanmodes'
	option.
- Default initial channel modes are now +nst if not configured.
- Extended ban type $u.  $u:nick!ident@host matches any clients
	that are not identified to services.
- SSLv3 is no longer supported.  SSL clients must support TLS v1.0+.
- Higher configurable channel limit for either certain opers or auth{} blocks.
- Network Administrator, or NetAdmin role, "higher" than "Admin."
	NetAdmin is required to perform remote rehash, restart, and module loading.
- Channel modes are now shown in /list and /olist.

In addition, these differences from Charybdis 3.4.2:
- Channel mode +T blocks channel notices.
- SSLv3 is an older encryption protocol that's no longer supported.
  SSL clients must support at least TLS v1.0+.

Note: The list may not be exhaustive.  Refer to the commit
	history for details.
