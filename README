Based on Charybdis 3.4.2.

Description:

    This IRCd is a Charybdis fork, designed for Chat Lounge
in mind.  It may or may not suit your needs.

    It may include some features from ShadowIRCd,
ElementalIRCd, Ircd-seven, and elsewhere.

Differences from Charybdis:

- Global nick change notices (snomask +N)
- SNO_SPY Server notices (extensions/sno_*_notice.c) are now global
	(L_NETWIDE).
- Usermode +B (Mark as bot in whois)
- Usermode +t - When enabled, only SSL/TLS users may message you.
- Oper override does not expire.  It still generates
	notices when used.
- Usermodes are shown in /whois.  Only shown when
	an oper performs the whois, or a self-whois.
- When a K-lined user connects, snomask +K shows it.
- Initial channel modes when a channel is created are
	now configurable with the 'autochanmodes'
	option.
- Default initial channel modes are now +nst.
- Channel mode +T blocks channel notices.
- Extended ban type $u.  $u:nick!ident@host matches any clients
	that are not identified to services.

Note: The list may not be exhaustive.  Refer to the commit
	history for details.
