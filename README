Based on Charybdis 3.4.2.

Description:

	This IRCd is a Charybdis fork, designed for Chat Lounge
in mind.  It may or may not suit your needs.

	It may include some features from ShadowIRCd,
ElementalIRCd, Ircd-seven, and elsewhere.

Differences from Charybdis:

- Global nick change notices (both global and local
	are controlled by snomask +n)
- Usermode +B (Mark as bot in whois)
- Oper override does not expire.  It still generates
	notices when used.
- Usermodes are shown in /whois.  Only shown when
	an oper performs the whois, or a self-whois.
- When a K-lined user connects, snomask +K shows it.

Note: The list may not be exhaustive.  Refer to the commit
	history for details.
